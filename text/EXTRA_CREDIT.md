# Extra credit

-   Implement a PSI protocol based on your implementation of the Paillier cryptosystem from the Homomorphic Encryption lesson. Confirm that it scales poorly as the size of the domain increases.
-   Implement a version of PSI based on ECDH instead of regular Diffie-Hellman. You should use an appropriate third-party ECDH library.
